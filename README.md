# ZONZA Engineering Center

## What is this?
This repository contains public information about technical aspects of [ZONZA (http://zonza.tv)](http://zonza.tv) for its
clients and also showcases our Open Source contributions.

The site is served using Jekyll/[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and can be viewed at http://howow.github.io

## Can I contribute?
Absolutely! If you work for ZONZA/Hogarth, simply submit a pull request with your changes. Once merged into the master branch, Github will compile and servce the site automatically for us :thumbsup:!

## Why is this on Github?
It makes sense for documentation to live alongside the code it is documenting and since we're already users of Github, it's familiar. It's also another way of us being a part of the thriving Open Source communitity on Github and being more open with our customers.

### What is Ad-ID?

Ad-ID is an industry standard for identifying advertising assets across all
media platforms. Since 31st March 2014, all commercials produced for
television, radio and digital platforms featuring SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors
Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) union members,
must now use Ad-ID as the sole standard commercial identifier and thus we
expect an increasing number of clients to expect support for it.

Ad-ID also refers to the paid service and web-based system available at
[http://ad-id.org](http://ad-id.org) that generates, and manages unique
codes for each asset. In addition the system stores a set of basic metadata
often referred to as a digital slate. This digital slate comprises a
standard set of mandatory and non-mandatory metadata fields that can be
stored centrally in the Ad-ID system and also embedded into assets using
the Adobe XMP protocol.

### How does ZONZA support Ad-ID?

Once Ad-ID has been configured for a client site, we support:

* Retrieval of metadata from the Ad-ID service into ZONZA given an Ad-ID
  identifier
* Search of assets in ZONZA using the Ad-ID identifier and metadata
* Automatic updating of metadata in ZONZA if it changes in the Ad-ID portal

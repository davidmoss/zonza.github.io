### Carousel

<div class="pull-right">
<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
<li>Supported image formats are JPEG and PNG; the recommended resolution is 1024 X 300 pixels</li>
<li>Content should be within boundaries shown in the <a href="/resources/myzonza-carousel-specs-with-guides.psd"><i class="fa fa-cloud-download"></i> Photoshop template</a> to ensure it is visible.</li>
</ul>
</div>

The carousel is a slider control that automatically rotates banners on the My
ZONZA personal homepage. These banners are displayed to everyone and are the
starting point for promoting content. These banners can also link to anywhere
on the web, for example an item or set in ZONZA, your marketing website,
support pages or social networking pages.

Users with permission can add, edit, and delete banners as required.

The Photoshop template (shown below) marks out all of the carousel overlays
to help you position and size these images. Ideally content should stay within
the red area. The minimum images size should be from green edge to green edge.

### Personal Homepage

My ZONZA is typically the landing page for users when they log into
ZONZA thus it is important for it to show the lastest, most relevant content.
Aside from the Carousel described above, content is dynamically updated
depending on each user’s browsing history and search preferences.

This is great for users who want to tailor the content shown to only that
which they are interested in e.g. content in a specific region, for a specific
brand, or assets waiting approval.

### Category pages

<div class="pull-right">
<h3>The Menu</h3>
<img src="/images/myzonza-category-menu.png"/>
<ul>
<li>Access category pages using the pulldown menu at the top of the Assets page in
ZONZA. All of the categories are shown and are visible to all users.</li>
<li>New category pages can be added if you have permission by clicking the last
icon.</li>
<li>You can always go back to your personal homepage by clicking the first home icon.</li>
</ul>
</div>

You can enrich your marketing collateral by creating branded Category pages
and set these pages up to provide end-users with contextual information and
files related to the brands they’re interested in, such as case studies,
research papers, industry white papers, market research, brand strategy, and
values.

The creation of categories is details in the Training Guide. Editing can be
restricted to any subset of users.
